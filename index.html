            <p>When we hired Ben to lead our mobile app development, our mobile app was pathetic. With Ben as leader we soon had the highest-rated mobile app in our market. Ben built the team, developed the team, re-architected the product and platform, took on product management, was an essential member of our leadership team and directly contributed to the turnaround of our technology and products. Ben is the best and I cannot recommend him highly enough.</p>

            <p>Ben is one of those savant-type technology leaders. He is well versed in Engineering, Design, and Product Management. He carries an intense desire to do what is right for the users of whatever he is building. Working with him has been one of the highlights of my career. His mental health advocacy and openness about his struggles make him an even more exceptional leader. His advocacy is felt by many in the USA; he also presented in India. In India, he was met with huge praise and relief from many people who had been suffering in silence.</p>

            <p>There are people in life who cross your path and leave you baffled by their excellence. Ben Norris is this person. Ben is one of those people who has an immaculate sense of style, aesthetic, clean-cut visuals and vision. When I think of Ben I think of his clean, white desk: Ben is precise, and he is organized. His knowledge and experience of Engineering, UX, AND Product runs deep- which is very much unheard of these days. Furthermore, I had the opportunity to watch Ben take on a leadership position and saw him build a powerful, lean, and delivering team; a team that supported one another but also called each other out on their BS. Ben has my highest esteem- I cannot recommend him enough!</p>
