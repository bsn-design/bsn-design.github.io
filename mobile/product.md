## Experience

I started in product management as the first product owner at [Waterford Institute](https://waterford.org) in 2010. I returned officially to that world in 2020 as I became the mobile product manager as well as engineering manager at [O.C. Tanner](https://www.octanner.com).

Having been an engineer and a designer, I am comfortable navigating the differences between those groups, and can help them work together most effectively.


## Work example

As mobile product manager, I was responsible for two flagship apps with native iOS and Android versions. One app was our existing legacy app used by customers around the world, and the other was a new app that we were starting to roll out. I needed to present our release strategy to the executive team.
