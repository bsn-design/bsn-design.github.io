## Experience

I started in product management as the first product owner at [Waterford Institute](https://waterford.org) in 2010. I returned officially to that world in 2020 as I became the mobile product manager as well as engineering manager at [O.C. Tanner](https://www.octanner.com).

Having been an engineer and a designer, I am comfortable navigating the differences between those groups, and can help them work together most effectively.

## Work example

As mobile product manager, I was responsible for two flagship apps with native iOS and Android versions. One app was our existing legacy app used by customers around the world, and the other was a new app that we were starting to roll out. I needed to present our release strategy to the executive team.

        <p>Ben is an excellent person and astute product leader. He is technically skilled and easily able to distill his expertise for consumption by the "business" folks. An excellent cross-functional collaborator willing to apply product feedback from internal stakeholders and clients almost immediately. I would love the opportunity to partner with Ben again and have enjoyed all of the projects we worked on together. Any team would be very lucky to even spend a few hours working with Ben.</p>

        <p>Ben is one of those people you work with that you want to learn from so that you can be more like them. When Ben speaks he is doing so because he is adding value and insight into the conversation. Ben has an ability to make you feel heard when you disagree, and to easily help you see perspective. In the triad or Product, Design, and Development, Ben is one of only two people who I would hire to do any of them for any product.</p>

        <p>I worked alongside Ben at OC Tanner as a Product Manager while he operated as the Engineering Manager, Product Manager, and UX Designer for his product. His ability to successfully exercise so many skill sets at once is impressive! He has a truly incredible and inspiring ability to approach situations with courage, kindness, and candor. Ben shows incredible strength in his leadership, decision making, work ethic, and vulnerability. I would jump at the chance to work with Ben again, and feel confident in the high value he will add to any organization.</p>
