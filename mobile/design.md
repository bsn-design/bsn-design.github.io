## Experience

Most of my career has involved user experience and user interface design, including for the industry-leading wireframe software company [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com).

For the past few years, I have focused on mobile app design, both designing [my own apps](/apps/), as well as enterprise mobile design for iOS and Android at [O.C. Tanner](https://www.octanner.com).


## Work example

I was asked to design a new flow for sending money internationally to someone. The first part of the flow was a redesign of existing functionality.

<div class="entries-grid">
    <div class="entry">
        <h3 class="entry-title">Original</h3>
        <img src="/assets/images/original-design.png" class="entry-image" alt="Original designs">
        <p class="entry-excerpt">The app had an existing aesthetic, and desired functionality for the feature I was asked to design.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="entry">
        <h3 class="entry-title">Version 1</h3>
        <img src="/assets/images/version-one.png" class="entry-image" alt="Design iteration">
        <p class="entry-excerpt">In the first version, I changed the UX flow to focus first on a person, and then on the amount to send.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="entry">
        <h3 class="entry-title">Final Designs</h3>
        <img src="/assets/images/final-design.png" class="entry-image" alt="Final designs">
        <p class="entry-excerpt">After getting client feedback, I adjusted the screens to be more heavily branded with a custom look and feel.</p>
    </div>
</div>
