Explore different aspects of health, with a focus on understanding and improving mental health.

***

This is a presentation that I have given at local meetups, and around the world to different work teams. Drawing on my own experiences with OCD, I wanted to put mental health in perspective of all kinds of health.

In the company where I worked as a software manager, O.C. Tanner, our wellness director and I went on something of a roadshow and delivered this presentation to many departments throughout the company. I loved the opportunity to share principles that have become so important in my life, and to open the conversation for many more people to discuss their own mental health at work.
