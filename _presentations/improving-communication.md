Discuss and consider approaches to communication, particularly the use of meetings.

***

This is a presentation I was asked to create to deliver to a group of executives to share my observations and recommendations on how communication could be more effective and efficient.

Following the presentation to the executive team, I was asked to attend team meetings of a number of departments in the company to share the same thoughts and encourage discussion on how they could improve.

I started the presentation by writing up my thoughts in a long essay: [Communication synchronicity](https://bennorris.com/2021/01/21/communication-synchronicity), which you can read if you have fifteen free and curious minutes.
