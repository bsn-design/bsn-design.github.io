## Why I created this
When I became a manager and started running meetings, I found there was not a simple way to prepare and present agenda in those meetings. I created Agendum to do just that. You can quickly and easily type up your notes, and then without any work at all, display a beautiful presentation to keep everyone engaged and on topic.

## Powerful outliner
A side benefit of creating Agendum to be a simple agenda preparation tool is that it is a great outliner. Use it to take notes, or just capture a brainstorm. You can easily indent or group topics together, and drag and drop to move them around.

## Presentation options
Agendum has many flexible presentation options. You can AirPlay to an Apple TV, connect to a projector or external screen, or present directly on your device. You can even control another device logged in to the same iCloud account.

## Keyboard shortcuts
With robust keyboard shortcuts, you can do all of your preparation and presentation without even having to touch the screen. If you would rather touch your content, you can use intuitive gestures to indent and create outlines, move content around, and control the presentation.

## Dark theme
A gorgeous dark theme makes preparing and presenting in low light easy on your eyes. And with automatic switching from light to dark themes, you can always have the best experience for the moment.

I hope this app helps you as much as it has me. Happy outlining!
-Ben
