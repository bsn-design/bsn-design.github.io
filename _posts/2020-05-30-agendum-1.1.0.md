This version is a complete rewrite of the app from the ground up, using SwiftUI, Apple's latest technology. Some of the highlights include:
- Integration with system dark mode
- Connect to external display for presentation
- Full support for iPadOS features, including multiple windows, multitasking, and trackpad integration

I have had a great time making this update and hope you enjoy using it.
