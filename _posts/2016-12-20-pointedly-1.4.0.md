Thank you for the great feedback and the generous tips. We are thrilled to bring you a few new features and fixes in time for Christmas.

## New Features
- Manually edit date for games so they can show up in the app as they actually happened. Thanks Bigker and Taylor for requesting it!
- Tap on a player's avatar while scoring a game to update the image for the avatar. Thanks Tatum N. for requesting it!


## Fixes
- Fixed a crash when sharing the results of a game from an iPad using iOS 10. Thanks JB, David J., Scott C., John B., and Steve C. for reporting it!
- Fixed a problem with the wrong player getting a score when sorting players by score. Thanks John B., Jon S., Curtis F., Jordan A., Edgar R., and Tatum N. for reporting it!
- Choosing an image for an avatar on an iPad now sizes the images properly. Thanks Barb B. for reporting it!
