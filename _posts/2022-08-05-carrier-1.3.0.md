This version adds the ability to send individual messages to recipients in a group. When editing the group, you can choose whether to send a group message or individual messages. Thanks Kelly M. for requesting this!

This also makes some other small fixes and improvements. Thanks for all your support, and let me know your thoughts on the update.
