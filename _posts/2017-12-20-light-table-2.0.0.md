Thank you for all the great input on how to improve Light Table. I am thrilled to bring you a major update in version 2.0.

## New Features
- All-new adjustable image outline mode that removes color and make it much easier to trace
- Previous image library to select an image you worked on before saved with all settings you had applied
- Drag and drop support for adding an image from another app (only available on iPad)

## Improvements
- Control lock has been completely redesigned to work better and protect you from moving your image while tracing
- Dot grid and crosshairs have been thickened to be more visible through most paper
- Auto-lock prevention so your device will not go to sleep while you are working
- Full iPhone X and iPad Pro compatibility
- Brand-new app icon
