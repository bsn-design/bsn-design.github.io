Along with iOS 9 support, this version adds some major updates. The app has undergone a beautiful design overhaul to make it easier to use. You now have the ability to restart a game with the same people and settings without overwriting the previous game and a bank of players so that you don't have to add the same person over and over again. We also added a gorgeous results screen so you can share all your victories.

Thanks for all your support and ideas. We are thrilled to be able to keep the app ad-free. We hope this makes your family games even easier!
