Thanks for your help with the release. This update fixes a couple issues that slipped through.

- Fixes a crash when trying to send feedback, which made sending any feedback much harder. Sorry!
- Fixes an issue that sometimes stopped a message from actually sending
- Fixes a problem with confetti never going away when rapidly sending multiple messages
- Launches related apps properly instead of waiting to load in the app

I hope this helps you schedule messages more easily and consistently!
