## Overview
We respect your right to privacy when using our apps.

Our privacy policy is simple: your data belongs to you. We make money by selling software, not by mining your personal information.

We try to avoid collecting any data about you.  When we do collect data, as much as possible, we make it anonymous and aggregated.

## Data Sharing
The data we collect from you is not shared with any other entity, except as described in the “Services We Use” section below. As a Limited Liability Corporation organized in Utah, United States, we may be required by law in some situations to share data with law enforcement or other government agencies.

## Services We Use
Your data may be collected by third-party services that we use when you purchase our apps or contact us for support. Here are links to the privacy policies of companies whose services we use, and a description of when and why we use their services:

- [Apple](https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/en-ww/). Because our apps are available through Apple platforms, information about your use of our apps may be collected by Apple.
- [Mailchimp](https://mailchimp.com/legal/privacy/). We use Mailchimp to manage our customer email lists for marketing purposes. Your name and email address will be shared with Mailchimp if you sign up to receive news and updates.

## Email Newsletter
As noted in the “Services We Use” section above, we use [Mailchimp](https://mailchimp.com/legal/privacy/) to send out email newsletters. You will only receive email from us if you have explicitly signed up to receive it, and you can unsubscribe at any time. Your information is not sold or shared in any way.

## Customer Support
If you contact us for support, we may store a copy of your request, our response, and any follow-up communication. This is saved so that we can provide better service.

## App Data
We do not transmit any information about your usage of our apps to third parties. Because our apps are available on Apple platforms, Apple can collect information about your usage. If you opt in to share that information with developers, we may get some information about your usage, such as whether you make purchases, or if you continue using the app. We can also receive information about any crashes that may occur while you are using our apps so that we can continue to improve them.

In addition, any data that is synced across your devices is saved in iCloud, and is private to you. We do not have access to that data. Your data is also not linked to any email address you may have provided if you registered for our email newsletter.

## California Online Privacy Protection Act Compliance

We comply with the California Online Privacy Protection Act. We therefore will not distribute your personal information to outside parties without your consent.

## Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act Compliance

We never collect or maintain information at our website from those we actually know are under 13, and no part of our website is structured to attract anyone under 13.

## Your Consent

By using our site or apps, you consent to our privacy policy.

## Exclusions

This privacy policy does not apply to any unsolicited information you provide to us, such as feature requests and feedback sent via our support channels. All unsolicited information shall be deemed to be non-confidential and we shall be free to reproduce, use, disclose, and distribute such unsolicited information to others without limitation or attribution.

## Policy Clarification

Please do not hesitate to [contact us](mailto:BSN Design <privacy@bsn.design>?subject=I have a question about privacy with BSN Design) if you have questions or concerns about our handling of your data, or to request that we delete the data we may have stored about you.

This document may be revised to clarify our policies or to update them to reflect our current handling of customer data.
